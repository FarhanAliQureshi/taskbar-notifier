# Taskbar Notifier

## Overview
This program sends notification to Windows Taskbar. It is a useful small utility when a console program wants to send a notification to Windows Taskbar (GUI) to inform the user. Python script, PowerShell script, Batch script, or even third-party programs can utilize this utility.

I originally wrote this utility in Visual Studio 2005, and later ported to VS2010. I was going through my backups and found it there, so I decided to port it to VS2022.

## Build Instructions
